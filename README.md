# Thumb Sliders for Flarum

A Flarum extension that displays an animated thumbnail image slider on the left side of each discussion in the discussion list. Images are automatically extracted from the first post content.

## Features

- **Automatic image extraction** - Detects images from the first post using fast XML parsing (s9e TextFormatter format), with HTML rendering fallback. Supports standard `<IMG>` tags and `fof/upload` `<UPL>` tags.
- **Smooth fade + scale animation** - Slick-style carousel with fade transitions and subtle zoom effect (`scale(1.2)` to `scale(1)`), powered by CSS transitions with no JavaScript animation libraries.
- **Lazy loading with IntersectionObserver** - Images are loaded only when the slider enters the viewport. Subsequent slides are preloaded in the background for seamless playback.
- **Smart layout integration** - Flexbox-based layout that automatically adapts when used alongside other extensions:
  - [**tryhackx/flarum-topic-rating**](https://github.com/TryHackX/flarum-topic-rating) - Star ratings are positioned cleanly next to tags
  - [**tryhackx/flarum-magnet-link**](https://github.com/TryHackX/flarum-magnet-link) - Magnet link elements integrate without overlap
  - [**fof/discussion-views**](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/discussion-views) - View counters are placed alongside reply counts
- **Responsive design** - Slider scales down on mobile devices (60px width) with adjusted counter text. Full desktop layout with configurable width.
- **Dark mode support** - Automatically adapts background and shadow for dark themes.
- **Image filtering** - Configurable minimum/maximum dimension filters. Automatically excludes emojis, avatars, favicons, icons, badges, logos, and SVGs.
- **Admin panel settings** - Full control over slider behavior without touching code.
